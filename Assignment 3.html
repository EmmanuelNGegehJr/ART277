  <h1> Travelling in Depression</h1>
    <p>When i was very little, i caught the travel bud. It started after my grondparents first brought me to their home in france and i have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has given me a unqiue learning experience.</p> <p>At five,I <span style="color:blue;"> marveled </span> Eiffel Tower in the city of lights. When l was eigth, i stood in the heart of piazza san Maco feeding hovdes of pigeons, then glided down Venetion Waterways on sleek fonddas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of stonehenge and walked

       along the Great wall of china, amazed that the thousand-year-old stones were still in place just as it in <span style="color:blue;"> Starz University</span>.</p>
        <p>It was through explaring culture,around the</p> 
       <p>It began with French, which taught me the importance of pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in paris where Rue des pyramides was. But when i pronounced it PYR-a-mides instead of pyr-A-mides, with more accent on the A, she looded at me bewildered.</p>
       <p>In the eighth grade, i became fascinated with speanish and aware of is similarities with English through cognates. Baseball in spaninh, for example, is béisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly the same.
       This was incredible to me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today i fine that cognates come to the reswe when i forget how to say something in spanish. <span style="color:blue;"> Send Us Email </span></p>
       <p> Then, in high school, i developed an enthusiasm for chinese. As i studied chinese at my school i marveled how if just one strok was missing from character the meaning is lost.</p>
       <p>Loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huô  meaning fire and shãn meaning moutain can be joined to create Huõsh ān which means volcano. I love spending hoors at a time practicing the characters and i can feel the and rhythm as i form them.</p>
